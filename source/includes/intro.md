# Introduction

## Engine
**Docker Engine** or "Docker" is the core component that is responsible for:
 - Building Images
 - Creating &amp; running containers
 - Managing containers. 

The `docker` binary can run as both a daemon and a client.  In daemon mode, it is responsible for managing containers and image builds.  As a client it is responsible for controlling a Docker daemon using the REST API that it exposes. 

## Docker Hub
Docker Hub is our hosted registry service for managing your images. There is nothing to install. This is used as the default registry by the Docker Engine. Users can create their own public and private image repositories by <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">creating a Hub account</a>.
